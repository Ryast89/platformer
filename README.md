This is a platformer project that I created (along with my group member) in three-four weeks for IT 12. (Grade 11)

Collision has issues depending on the system that the game is played on, which I was never able to resolve. Other than that, the game is functional.

All assets were either made by us or taken from no-copyright sources.

You can download the game at https://mdinfotech.net/examples/Computer%20Science%2012/Games/ - it's in the 2018-2019 section, called "Reach the top!"
